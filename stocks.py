# # Stock Analysis with yfinance, seaborn and plotly
#
# In this notebook, we created a class using yfinance and plotly to download and analyze stock data. The class automatically retrieves OHLC data for a given ticker symbol (e.g., 'NFLX') from Yahoo Finance.
#
# ## **Key Analyses:**
# 1. **Retrieving Data:**
#    Used yfinance to fetch daily OHLC data (Open, High, Low, Close) and other stock information like Volume for the selected ticker.
#
# 2. **Closing Price, Volume, and Daily Change:**
# - Visualized the closing price over time.
# - Analyzed trading volume and calculated daily percentage changes in stock price.
#   
# 3. **Moving Averages:** 
# Computed 10-day, 20-day and 50-day Moving Averages to identify short-term and long-term stock trends.
#
# 4. **Daily Return:**
# Calculated daily returns to assess average performance and volatility.
#
# 5. **Candlestick Chart:**
# Created an interactive candlestick chart to visualize the stock's price movements using the Open, High, Low, and Close data.

# # 1. Closing Price, Volume, Daily Change
#
# Closing price serves as a key indicator in analyzing the performance of that stock over time. Investors typically use the closing price as the benchmark for evaluating the performance of a stock.
# Historical closing prices will be ised to calculate the moving average, percentage change, and volatility.
#
# Volume is a fundamental metric in trading, especially when used in conjunction with price analysis. For instance, a price increase along with high volume often signifies strong buying interest, while a price increase with low volume may signal a lack of conviction and may not be sustainable.

# # 2. Moving average
#
# The moving average (MA) is a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks, or any time period the trader chooses.

# # 4. Daily return.

# Now that we've done some baseline analysis, let's go ahead and dive a little deeper. We're now going to analyze the risk of the stock. In order to do so we'll need to take a closer look at the daily changes of the stock, and not just its absolute value. Let's go ahead and use pandas to retrieve teh daily returns for the Apple stock.

# # 5. Candlestick
#
# A candlestick chart is a type of financial chart used to represent the price movement of an asset over a specific time period. Itâ€™s widely used in technical analysis to help visualize the open, high, low, and close prices (OHLC) for a particular time frame (e.g., daily, hourly).

# Calculate the 10-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
NFLX['EMA10'] = NFLX['Close'].ewm(span=10, adjust=False).mean()
NFLX['EMA50'] = NFLX['Close'].ewm(span=50, adjust=False).mean()

    x=NFLX.index,            
    open=NFLX['Open'],     
    high=NFLX['High'],        
    low=NFLX['Low'],         
    close=NFLX['Close'],
