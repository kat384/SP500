            '\nInstead of being outliers in the traditional sense, these companies are '
            'leaders that define the sector\'s performance - holding 51.68/%, $18,937T '
            'of its total sector market capitalization. Their dominance shifts the focus '
            'from "anomalies to exclude" to "key drivers to analyze."'
            '\n'
            '\n**Sector Dynamics:**\n'
            'The data suggests a highly skewed distribution in the sector, where a '
            'few dominant players disproportionately control market capitalization. This '
            'reflects a power-law distribution. Their outsized impact suggests a level of '
            'stability, but it also raises concerns about sector dependency.'
            '\n'
            '\n**Implications for Risk Analysis:**\n'
            'The concentration of influence among a few outliers may require a shift in '
            'how risks are assessed. Instead of focusing on the average performance of companies '
            'in the sector, attention must be paid to these dominant players and their '
            'vulnerabilities.'

col2.markdown('\n**Strategic Opportunities:**'
            '\nFrom a business or investment perspective, these outliers serve as benchmarks and '
            'offer insights into the characteristics that drive success in the sector. However, '
            'their dominance also creates opportunities for smaller firms to innovate in niche '
            'areas.\n'

            '\nThe dominance of technology outliers in the S&P index has significant '
            'implications. Their substantial market-cap weight makes the S&P heavily reliant '
            'on their performance, driving index movements and amplifying sectoral influence. '
            'This concentration poses risks during tech downturns, as their underperformance can '
            'disproportionately drag the index down. Conversely, their innovation and growth '
            'can boost investor confidence and attract capital flows into S&P-linked funds. '
            'However it may skew perceptions of market health by masking weaknesses in other '
            'sectors.')
